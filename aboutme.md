I'm just another person trying to make sense of things. I don't have any answers. My work has taken me through software design, systems architecture, and AI models - but what really interests me are questions about the nature of reality, how we know what we know, and what we might never fully understand.

This blog is where I explore those questions. If you're curious how someone with an engineering background thinks about self, society, and reality, you might find something here that resonates.
