On the internet, messages from your device travel through many routers, ISPs, and international cables. With HTTP, data travels unprotected. It's like sending a transparent and unsealed envelope through the mail.

When you send sensitive information online (like credit card details or login credentials), you don't want anyone on the route to **read your data**, or **tamper with it** (for example, by injecting malware), or **pretend to be the website you're visiting** (phishing). While HTTP doesn't prevent any of these from happening, **HTTPS** uses a **security protocol** that protects communication between your browser and servers worldwide. This security protocol is called **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**, and it protects your data when it moves across the internet.

HTTPS is essentially **HTTP over TLS**, that is, the same HTTP request but **encrypted, protected, and verified using TLS**. HTTPS uses port 443 instead of the HTTP port 80. 

In the **OSI model**, TLS sits between the **application layer and the transport layer**. Think of TLS as a security guard standing between your app and the network. It secures HTTP data sent by applications (in the application layer) before passing it to the web server working at the transport layer. TLS effectively provides three key guarantees:
1. **Confidentiality**: TLS scrambles (**encrypts**) your data in a way that only the intended recipient can unscramble (**decrypt**) it. In a real world analogy, TLS locks your letter in a box and only the intended recipient has the key.
2. **Integrity**: TLS ensures that your data can't be changed in transit and if someone tries, it would be detected. It‚Äôs like sealing your letter with wax - if it‚Äôs broken, you know it was tampered with.
3. **Authentication**: To make sure that you're not sending sensitive information to an imposter, TLS verifies the website's **digital certificate** (like an ID badge).

There are two commonly used types of **encryption**:
1. **Symmetric Encryption**: Imagine locking your letter in a box that can be locked and unlocked with the same key. Both the sender and the recipient own a copy of this key.
2. **Asymmetric Encryption**: Imagine locking a box with one key, but needing a different key to unlock it. The sender uses a locking key, and only the recipient has the correct key to open it.

In this post, we'll focus on **TLS 1.3** - the latest and most secure version of the protocol. While TLS 1.3 offers the most security, its adoption is still ongoing, and older versions of TLS, like TLS 1.2, are still widely used. 

## How TLS 1.3 works:

Before any **encrypted data** gets exchanged, there‚Äôs a **TLS handshake** - it's like a conversation starter between a client (like your browser) and a server (like `https://example.com`). The handshake‚Äôs job is to:
- Help both sides **prove their identity**
- Let them **agree on a shared secret key** for encryption
- Ensure no one can eavesdrop, tamper, or replay the conversation

TLS 1.3 simplifies the handshake process to **just three steps**:

### 1. ClientHello (Client -> Server)

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                   SERVER (WEBSITE)
    |                                                  |
    |--- ClientHello --------------------------------->|
    |     - Client ephemeral public key                |
    |     - Supported cipher suites                    |
    |     - Supported TLS version                      |
    |     - Random number                              |
```

The client kicks things off by generating a **temporary** key pair (a private key + public key) using elliptic curve cryptography. It then sends the server:
- The generated **public key**
- A list of supported cipher suites (encryption methods)
- The highest TLS version it supports
- A random number (used later during key derivation)

All of this is **unencrypted**.

### 2. ServerHello + Encrypted Handshake (Server -> Client)
Now it‚Äôs the server‚Äôs turn to respond.

#### 2.1 ServerHello

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                   SERVER (WEBSITE)
    |                                                  |
    |                       Generates own key pair <== |
    |<-- ServerHello ----------------------------------|
    |     - Server ephemeral public key                |
    |     - Chosen cipher suite                        |
    |     - Random number                              |
    |                                                  |
```

The server also generates its own temporary key pair and sends back:
- The **server generated public key**
- The chosen cipher suite (picked from the client's list)
- **Another** random number

This part is still **unencrypted**.

#### 2.2. Deriving the Handshake Keys

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                   SERVER (WEBSITE)
    |                                                  |
    |===== Both sides perform ECDHE ================== |
    |===== Derive shared secret seed ================= |
    |===== Use HKDF to generate handshake keys ======= |
    |                                                  |
```

Both sides now have what they need to compute a **shared secret**. Using the **Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman algorithm** (usually **ECDHE**), each side combines:
- Its own private key
- The other party‚Äôs public key

This results in a **shared secret seed** (also referred to as **shared secret**). Thanks to the magic of ECDHE, both sides arrive at the **same secret** without ever sending it over the network. Even if someone were watching, they couldn't derive the secret because private keys never leave the respective devices. It's like two people using a secret recipe that creates the same dish but never sharing the ingredients.

Next, both sides feed this seed into **HKDF** (a Key Derivation Function). HKDF uses:
- The **shared secret seed**
- A **transcript hash** (a digest of the handshake so far)
- A **context label** like `tls13 finished` or `tls13 c hs traffic`

From this, they generate **encryption keys**:
- `client_handshake_traffic_key`: Generated using the context label `tls13 c hs traffic`. Used for encrypting and decrypting client -> server messages
- `server_handshake_traffic_key`: Generated using the context label `tls13 s hs traffic`. Used for encrypting and decrypting server -> client messages

These keys are computed **independently** on both sides but are **identical** due to the shared inputs.

> üìù Note: While the random numbers sent in ClientHello and SeverHello aren‚Äôt direct inputs to computation of the raw seed, they do influence all derived secrets through the transcript hash. Thus, they ensure that each session has a unique context, even if the same ECDHE keys were (hypothetically) reused.

#### 2.3. Encrypted Handshake Phase Begins

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                   SERVER (WEBSITE)
    |                                                  |
    |<-- Encrypted Extensions (using handshake key) -- |
    |<-- Certificate (encrypted) --------------------- |
    |<-- CertificateVerify (digital signature) ------- |
    |<-- Finished (MAC proving handshake integrity) -- |
    |                                                  |
```

The server now uses the `server_handshake_traffic_key` to encrypt the next set of messages:
- **Digital certificate**: This is like a passport issued by a trusted authority (a **Certificate Authority** or CA). It includes the domain, the server‚Äôs public key, the issuing CA, validity dates, and a digital signature (encrypted using the **CA's private key** and can be unencrypted using its public key). The client browser can verify the signature using the CA‚Äôs public key, which is built into the browser.
- **CertificateVerify**: A **digital signature** encrypted using the **server's private key**. This can be decrypted using the public key of the sever in the certificate.
- **`Finished` message**: This is a **MAC (Message Authentication Code)**, generated using a special `Finished` key (derived via HKDF from the server‚Äôs secret `server_handshake_traffic_secret` + the handshake transcript). It proves that the server has the correct secrets and hasn‚Äôt tampered with anything.

### 3.  Finish (Client ‚Üí Server)

#### 3.1 Client verifies the server's Identity

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                   SERVER (WEBSITE)
    |                                                  |
    |==> Validates certificate                         |
    |==> Verifies server signature                     |
    |==> Computes transcript hash and MAC              |
    |                                                  |
```

The client decrypts the server‚Äôs messages using the `server_handshake_traffic_key`, then performs several checks: 
- Is the **TLS certificate** still valid?
- Was it issued by a **trusted CA**?
- Does it match the **domain name** of the server?
- Is the **CA‚Äôs digital signature valid**?
- Can it verify the server‚Äôs signature (CertificateVerify) using the public key from the certificate?

It also verifies the server‚Äôs **Finished MAC** by generating its own version of the `Finished` key and comparing the MACs. 

If anything‚Äôs off, the client **aborts the handshake** and shows an error like *"Connection not secure"*. 

#### 3.2 Client sends Finished

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                   SERVER (WEBSITE)
    |                                                  |
    |--- Finished ------------------------------------>|
    |                                                  |
```

If everything checks out, the client sends its own Finished message, encrypted with the `client_handshake_traffic_key`. This message:
- Proves to the server that the client has derived the correct keys
- Confirms that the client trusts the server‚Äôs identity

Only once this is done can **encrypted communication** begin. 

### Post Handshake

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                   SERVER (WEBSITE)
    |                                                  |
    |                                                  |
    |=== Both sides derive application traffic keys == |
    |    using updated secrets and transcript hash     |
    |                                                  |
    |=== Secure encrypted communication begins ======= |
    |                                                  |
```

With the handshake complete, both the client and server derive a new set of **encryption keys**, called the **application traffic keys**. They‚Äôre based on the same shared secret seed from the handshake, but with **different context labels**:
- `client_application_traffic_key`: Encrypts and decrypts messages from client -> server
- `server_application_traffic_key`: Encrypts and decrypts messages from server -> client

From this point forward, all communication is encrypted using these **symmetric keys**. That means the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt a given message (as opposed to asymmetric cryptography, where encryption and decryption keys are different).

So, in TLS 1.3:
- **Asymmetric encryption** is used only during the handshake, to establish trust (certificate verification) and derive a shared secret seed.
- **Symmetric encryption** is used afterward for fast, secure communication.

### TLS 1.3 = 1-RTT Handshake
While a TCP handshake technically involves **1.5 round trips**, TLS 1.3 is known as a **1-RTT protocol**, because:
- By the end of the second flight (when the server responds), both parties already have all they need to derive the application keys.
- The client‚Äôs first actual request can be sent together with its Finished message, piggybacking on that final handshake step. So, there‚Äôs no need to wait for another round trip before starting secure data transfer.

### Other Keys Used in TLS 1.3
TLS 1.3 also defines additional types of keys beyond the main handshake and application keys:
- **Resumption Key**: TLS 1.3 allows the browser to resume a session **without repeating the full handshake**, by sending a **resumption master secret** (a temporary one-time use only pass that only works if the browser comes back soon). From that, the server generates a **resumption key** that lets the browser connect quickly and securely.
- **Key Update Keys**: For long-lived sessions, TLS 1.3 supports key updates. Both parties can **periodically generate new application traffic keys**, reducing the risk of long-term key compromise.

### Whats the point of so much randomness?
Randomness is at the heart of TLS 1.3‚Äôs security. Here's why it matters:

#### 1. Unique secret keys for every session
Each handshake generates a **fresh ephemeral key pair**, leading to a **new shared secret seed** and **new encryption keys**. This ensures:
- Every session is **isolated**.
- A hacker can‚Äôt use data from one session to crack another.

#### 2. No Replay Attacks
A **replay attack** is when someone reuses past messages to impersonate a client. For example, a hacker might try to log into your Gmail account by resending yesterday‚Äôs login messages. That won‚Äôt work in TLS 1.3 because:
- Each session uses **new ephemeral keys**.
- That results in a **different shared secret seed** and **different encryption keys**.
- The attacker‚Äôs replayed messages won‚Äôt produce the correct Finished MAC, so the server aborts the connection immediately.

#### 3. Forward Secrecy
TLS 1.3 ensures **forward secrecy**, which means:
- Encryption keys are **never stored**.
- If someone steals your server‚Äôs long-term private key later, they still can‚Äôt decrypt past sessions, because session specific secrets are gone forever.

It‚Äôs like burning both the lock and the key after each session - no one can ever reconstruct them.

#### 4. Freshness in Resumed Sessions
Even during **session resumption**, TLS 1.3 introduces **fresh randomness**. So while the client and server can skip parts of the handshake, they don‚Äôt reuse the same keys. That keeps resumed sessions just as secure as new ones.


## Session Resumption in TLS 1.3

When you visit a website over HTTPS, your browser and the server perform a full TLS 1.3 handshake - exchanging keys, verifying identities, and setting up encryption. This ensures privacy and trust but takes a bit of time and computing effort. If you connect soon after, TLS **session resumption** lets you skip parts of that handshake, saving time, computing power, and bandwidth, **without compromising security**.

#### 1. Issuing the Session Ticket

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                      SERVER
    |                                                  |
    |============ Full TLS 1.3 Handshake ============= |
    |                                                  |
    |<-- NewSessionTicket (contains resumption_psk) ---|
    |                                                  |
    |==> Stores session ticket and PSK for future use  |
    |                                                  |
```

Once a full handshake is complete, both client and server derive a **shared secret** called the `resumption master secret` using HKDF and their handshake secrets. The server then derives a `resumption_psk` PSK (Pre-Shared Key) from this master secret, again using HKDF. 

It then sends the client a **NewSessionTicket** message, which includes:
- `ticket`: A blob that encodes the PSK (**opaque** to the client)
- `ticket_lifetime`: How long the ticket is valid
- `ticket_age_add`: A random offset added to the client‚Äôs clock for security
- `ticket_nonce`: A unique value used when deriving the PSK
- `ticket_id`:  A unique identifier for this session ticket

This message is sent **after the handshake** and is encrypted using the **application traffic keys**.

The client receives and decrypts the message but it doesn't decrypt the `ticket`. Instead it stores `ticket_id`, `ticket` and associated metadata for future use.

#### 2. Reconnecting with PSK + Binder

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                      SERVER
    |                                                  |
    |--- ClientHello (includes:                        |
    |       - new client ephemeral public key          |
    |       - chosen cipher suite                      |
    |       - random number                            |
    |       - pre_shared_key extension with:           |
    |           - PSK identity (ticket_id)             |
    |           - Binder proving knowledge of PSK) --->|
    |                                                  |
```

When the client reconnects to the server, it sends a ClientHello message, just like it would in a full handshake (including a **new public key** derived using elliptic curve math). But this time, it includes a `pre_shared_key` extension, containing:
- One or more **PSK identities** (ticket IDs from earlier sessions)
- Corresponding **binders**, one for each PSK

For every PSK identity, the client computes a **binder** using the **current** ClientHello transcript hash (`transcript_hash`):
```
early_secret_seed = HKDF-Extract(salt=0, resumption_psk)
binder_key = HKDF-Expand(early_secret_seed, "resumption binder", "", num_bytes_output)
binder = HMAC(binder_key, transcript_hash)
```
The binder proves that the client possesses the secret `resumption_psk` associated with the ticket.

#### 3. Server Verifies the Binder and Accepts

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                      SERVER
    |                                                  |
    |                          Checks PSK validity <== |
    |                     Computes expected binder <== |
    |                                                  |
    |   ServerHello (includes:  ---------------------- |
    |       - index of accepted PSK                    |
    |<---   - new ECDHE public key)                    |
    |                                                  |
```

The server receives the ClientHello and checks for the `pre_shared_key` extension. It examines each PSK identity in order of client preference. For each one:
- It checks if it still has the **corresponding session ticket**
- Verifies the **ticket‚Äôs validity** (authenticity, expiration, etc.)
- **Recomputes the binder** using its own copy of the `resumption_psk`
- **Compares the computed binder** with the one sent by the client

If the binder matches, it means the client possesses the correct PSK, and the server selects this PSK for resumption.

The server then responds with a ServerHello, containing:
- The **index** of the accepted PSK identity (from the client‚Äôs list)
- A **new ephemeral public key** (generated using ECDHE)

**No certificate is sent during resumption** as it is assumed that the client already trusts the server based on the earlier full handshake.

#### 4. PSK + ECDHE Key Derivation and Completion

```
CLIENT (BROWSER)                                      SERVER
    |                                                  |
    |=== Perform ECDHE key agreement with new keys === |
    |=== Derive new handshake keys + Finished key ==== |
    |                                                  |
    |<-- Server Finished ----------------------------- |
    |                                                  |
    |--- Client Finished ----------------------------->|
    |                                                  |
    |=== Both sides derive new application traffic  == |
    |    keys using updated secrets                    |
    |                                                  |
    |=== Secure encrypted communication resumed ====== |
    |                                                  |
```


At this point, both sides have:
- Their own ephemeral key pair (freshly generated)
- The other side‚Äôs ephemeral public key
- A shared PSK (from the session ticket)

Using these, the client and server perform a **fresh ECDHE exchange**, and combine it with the PSK (in multiple stages, not as a single blob) to derive:
- A **new shared secret seed**
- **Fresh** handshake traffic keys
- **New** application traffic keys
- Finished keys, MAC keys, etc.

The server sends a Finished message encrypted using the new `server_handshake_traffic_key`, and the client replies with its own Finished. Once that‚Äôs done, they can immediately begin encrypted application data exchange, just like in a full handshake.


TLS 1.3 may seem intimidating at first glance, but once you break it down into its handshake steps, key derivation process, and session resumption mechanics, it becomes a clear example of elegant security by design. Whether you're building APIs, debugging HTTPS issues, or just trying to understand what‚Äôs going on beneath the padlock icon in your browser, TLS 1.3 is a foundational piece of modern internet security.

Happy (secure) building!
