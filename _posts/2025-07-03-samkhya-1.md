Samkhya school is the oldest dualistic school of Indian Darshan. If you've every the heard the words Purusha and Prakriti being casually thrown around by social media influencers, spiritual gurus, or XXX, you'll learn about the first philosophy to present them in philosophically rigorous manner. We find Samkhya's mention directly in Mahabharata and Bhagvad Gita, which is a testament to how ancient it is. 

Samkhya is also the foundaitonal basis for a lot of other spiritual and philosophical schools that came after it, like Yoga (Patanjali Yoga Sutras), Vedanata (particularly Shankaracharya), Tantra (Kashmiri Shaivism), etc. These schools essentially tried to remove the fractures and inconsistencies of the Samkhya Darshan in their own way. Thus, knowing what Samkhya believed becomes extremely importance to know where others are coming from. It is the second chapter in Bhagwad Gita, that is, when Krishna finally starts to speak, teachings of Samkhya philosophy are the first that come out of him.
