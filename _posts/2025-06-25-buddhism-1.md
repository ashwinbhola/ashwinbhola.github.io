The story begins in 5th century BCE (~2500 years ago), when Prince Siddhartha was born. His journey from Siddhartha to Buddha is nothing short of prophecies, conviction, mysticism, and XXX but it's difficult to tell which stories are true and which are fabricated. During his life, nothing about him or what he spoke was written down. 

In the 500 years that followed Buddha's death, his disciples compiled his teachings and discourses in a scripture named Pali Canon (Tripitaka). The Pali Canon is divided into 3 Pitakas (Pali for baskets), namely Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka. Vinaya Pitaka focuses on rules of conduct for monastic life, Sutta Pitaka preserves what is traditionally considered the direct speech of the Buddha, and Abhidhamma Pitaka dives into the philosophical exposition of the Buddhaâ€™s teachings. 

As we shall see, Buddha maintained silence on 10 metaphysical questions and siscouraged his disciples from getting involved in speculation as they distract one from true awakening. He also believed that all these questions are the result of misunderstanding the very nature of reality. His disciples though interpreted his silence in their own ways which led to the development of over a 100 schools of Buddhism. In this post, I'll be focusing solely on the doctorines that can be found in the Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka. We don't know if Buddha ever gave these metaphysical theories himself or if these were added later. But Pali Canon is our only source of truth, so let's explore the Buddha of Pali Canon.

In his first sermon after liberation (Nirvana), Buddha gave 4 noble truths (Arya Satya):
1. The world is full of suffering (Dukha)
2. There is a cause of suffering (Dukha Samudaya)
3. There is a cessation of suffering (Dukha Nirodha)
4. There is a path leading to the cessation of suffering (Dukha Nirodha Gamini Pratipada)

A lot of western philosophers have criticized Buddhism, and Indian Philosophy in general, for being pessimistic and centered around suffering. This confusion is a result of partial understanding of Indian Philosophy. While Buddhism and many other schools of Indian Philosophy start with the concept of suffering, they always end in removal of suffering (liberation).

Another concept central to Buddha's teachings is the theory of cause and effect (Pratitya Samutpada). He treats it like a natural law - that is, everything and everyone in the world is bound by the chain of cause and effect. Pratitya Samutpada is best summarized by "THIS being, THAT arises", which is why it is also called the "Theory of Dependent Origination". The theory says that everything that exists currently in the world is an effect of previous causes and will act as a cause of what will exist next. To put it differently, nothing in the empirical world has any independent existence - all that exists is relative, conditional, and dependent.

Buddha uses the principle of Pratitya Samputpada to articulate his doctrine of impermanence (Anityavada). The debate between philosophical Eternalism and Nihilism has appeared in various forms across different traditions and eras. While Eternalism believes the ultimate reality to be real and eternal (sat), certain radical schools of Nihilism use metaphors like "flying horse" or "barren women's son" to describe the illusory and conceptually constructed nature of the world. Anityavada is the middle path between these two opposing views. Reality is neither eternal nor completely unreal for Buddha - the world and everything in it is temporary and its existence is dependent on a web of interconnected causes.

After Anityavada and Pratitya Samutpada, Buddhism talks about the Doctrine of Momentariness (Kshanikvada). Kshanikvada talks about how everything exists only for a moment (kshan). Here, kshan is the most granular unit of time - instant and moment are its closest english translations. Kshanikvada is only implicitly mentioned in the Abhidhamma Pitaka and isn't there in the Sutta Pitaka.

If we combine Pratitya Samutpada with Kshanikvada, we see that everthing is a cause and an effect in the same moment. Think about a rotating chariot wheel - in every moment, it is leaving its previous position , which is the cause of its current position. Simultaneously the wheel is also moving into a new position, which is the effect of its current position. This implies that any talk about the position of wheel is futile. Everything is arising and ceasing in the same moment - that is, things are always in a state of becoming and not being. As per Buddha, material things are aggregates of momentary material atoms and living beings are aggregates of five momentary skandhas (Sanghatavada). 

But then the question arises - if the building blocks of material things and living beings are momentary, why do we percieve the world and everything in it to be existing continuously? To answer this, Buddha gives the example of a flame: In a flame, every atom is continuously in flux but it's so rapid that the change is imperceptible to us. Another example to illustrate this: Videos are nothing but a sequence of frames being played at a speed that makes us percieve them as something continuous. Similarly, the continuous flow of momentary atoms and skandhas of the world through cause and effect is so fast that it gives an impression of things existing permanently. This the theory of Sanatanavada.

Does this mean that we are also momentary? As per Buddha, yes. The 5 skandhas that are responsible for all the mental and bodily processes of living beings as per Sanghatavada are: Rupa (body), feelings, perceptions, mental tendencies, and consciousness. When we look at these, we find all these to be kshanik - they change from moment to moment. This means what we percieve as "self" is just an ever-changing stream of these 5 skandhas. Also, if everything in the world is dependent and conditional as per Pratitya Samutpada, that means we are not merely temporary but also conditional and dependent in our existence. This is how Buddhism rejects the idea of an eternal unchanging soul within us and gave is No-Self Doctrine (Anatmavada). Buddha compares our love for eternal soul to the lover of a beautiful lady who has not been seen or heard by anyone. 

We should note that Buddha only rejects the idea a permanent self. He does accept self or soul as a momentary aggregate - his idea of soul is very similar to that of Descartes. Both accept soul as the practical knower - that is, soul is the entity that does all the mental processes in us, like knowing, doubting, and thinking. Hume and Heraclitus hold very similar views to Buddha of Pali Canon about self.
