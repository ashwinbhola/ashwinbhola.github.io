Imagine you're building your own blog and in the beginning, it's just static HTML, CSS, JS files you have to put in there. After 1-2 years, your blog takes off and now you want to monetize it. You want to now allow people to pay a certain amount as a monthly or yearly subscription fee and in return they'll get access to a "Members Only" section on your blog which will have more posts than what non-paying visitors to the blog can see.

For this, you need to allow people to have their accounts on your blog so they can log in and the content they will then see will based on based on whether they are a paid subscriber or not. Essentially, you want to set up an authentication mechanism to recognize who the user is and an authorization mechanism to see which posts they're allowed to read. Let's look at two very popular ways of achieving this: Session based authentication and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
