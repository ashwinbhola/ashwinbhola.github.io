In all schools of Indian Philosophy, Jainism's Philosophy stands out for multiple reasons. In a world where we crave absolutes and certainity, this school primarily asks "What if everyone's right?". 

Let's look very briefly at an ideological war going on 2500 years ago, in both India and Greece. Vedanta school of philosophy believed that the ultimate reality can't be subject to change and can't be affected by time. For them, all change is an illusion (a very crude translation of the correct word here, mithya) and the ultimate reality itself is eternal and unchanging. Buddhism argued that everything in the world is subject to origination and decay. Thus, change is the only constant in the world. To put it more bluntly, impermanance is the only fundamental reality in this world and clinging to any permanence causes suffering. 

In Greece, Heraclitus (similar to Buddhism) famously said "You cannot step into the same river twice" -- he believed reality to be an ever changing dynamic process. For him, any stability that we percieve in the world is an illusion. While Heraclitus embraces becoming, Parmenides insists on being. For something to change, it must stop being what it is and start being something else. In this state of transition from one state to another, that thing enters the state of non-being (even if for a moment) and that is a logical impossibility. Thus, Parmenides (similar to Vendata) rejected all movement and change and argued that reality is eternal, indivisible, and unchanging and it is only our senses that deceive us into thinking otherwise.

To understand how Jainism views ultimate reality, let's look at their example of 6 blind men who happen to meet an elephant on their way and are trying to understand what this object is. Each one touches the elephant in a different place and thus, interpretes the elephant to be something else. The person who holds the trunk thinks the elephant is a snake, the one who holds the leg thinks the elephant is a pillar, another one holding the tail of the elephant declares it to be a rope, and so on.

Jainism believes that humans beings trying to understant reality are just like the blind men trying to understand the elephant. Reality is complex, multifaceted, and has infinite different aspects to it. Any statement or judgement (Naya) made by ordinary beings about reality is made from a particular POV (place, time, and perspective). Ordinary beings are limited by their finite cognitive capacities. Thus, we can't see reality as it truly is but only as it appears to us through the lens we use to understand it (Epistemological relativism). Jainism also holds that reality consists of infinite souls and infinite material atoms (Pluralism), which are all separately and independently real (Realism), and all these entities have infinite characters/modes to them as well. These are the basis of their theory of manyness of reality, Anekantavada --  the doctorine (`vada`) of many (`aneka`) aspects (`anta`).

The Jaina philosophy is described as "Realistic and Relativistic Pluralism". While the metaphysical side of their philosophy is called "Anekantavada", the epistemological side is called "Nayvada" (the theory of partial perspectives) -- all human knowledge and understanding is and will always be limited (by our physical and cognitive capacities), conditioned (by our perspective/standpoint), and relative (to our POV). Jainism points out that other philosophy schools commit themselves to a single point of view (Ekantavada). This makes their understanding of reality an inadequate expression. For Jainism, all views on reality hold some truth to them, but are incomplete. Thus, we should be tolerant to all alternate views. `Naya` refers to both, our POV or partial knowledge, and the statemt we make using that POV. 

As per Jainism, we can speak about about reality in 3 ways:
- If we make absolute assertions (e.g., This pen absolutely exists), these are invalid judgements (Durniti)
- If we don't declare our statments as absolute truths, but also don't mention that they are relative to our POV (e.g., This pen exists), they are still invalid (Naya)
- If we add **Syat** (means "Relatively Speaking") before every statement (e.g., Syat, this pen exists), our statements become valid i.e. our Naya becomes Pramana (Syadvada)

Coming back to the main question, can you step in the same river twice then? Jainism beautifully answers this with their statement:
```
Utpadavyaya dhrauvyam samyuktam sat
Utpada: Origination
Vyaya: Decay
Dhrauvyam: Permanence
Samyuktam: Combination
sat: Reality
```
This phrase translates into: "That which is a combination of origination, destruction, and permanence is real (sat)". According to Jainas, no real entity is absolutely static or absolutely fluid i.e. change and permanence coexist in everything. Every real object has some essential qualities (Gunas) which are permanent and some accidential qualities or modes (called Paryaya) that are subject to change. Some examples:
- For a soul, consciousness is its guna while pleasure and pain are its paryaya: Soul will go through cycles of pleasure and pain but its consciousness is eternal
- For a pot, the clay that made it is its guna while its shape is its paryaya: Over time, the pot may break or crack, but despite these changes, there is a substance (clay) that underlies and persists

So, when someone believes reality to be ever changing, Jainas say that they are looking at the modes of reality (Paryaya) and when someone says that reality is eternal and unchanging, they are looking at reality from the lens of gunas. Both these claims about reality (Ekantavada) hold truth to them but are partial truths only as each of them is looking dogmatically at one side (Ekanta) of reality. As per Jainism, both should be preceded by **Syat** for them to be taken as Pramana, and the complete truth reveals itself when we look at reality from different perspectives. It's important that we don't confuse Jainism philosophy to be agnostic or sceptic. Instead of saying that all knowledge is uncertain or probable, they emphasise the conditional and relative character of knowledge. 

If you felt a slight itch about this philosophy, don't worry -- this philosophy has been criticised by its contemporary schools as well. One famous criticsim to all relativism philosophies is that relaitvity can't be sustained without an absolute i.e. it is an absolute at the end that is merely perceived or expressed differently depending on the lens through which it's viewed.
